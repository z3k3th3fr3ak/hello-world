# hello-world

Hello fellow coders,

My name is Ezekiel Blwoers, I am 34 years old. I live with my wife, Daphne, and my son, Hezekiah. I used to be a truck driver, now I'm trying to get into the software engineering profession. I'm hoping that I will be able to give my wife and son everything they want. In high school I loved building computers and working on them. I want to change my profession because everything is going to computers.

“Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.
It matters that you don't just give up.”

― Stephen Hawking
